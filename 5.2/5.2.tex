  {Evolutionary Programming}
  \begin{block}{}
    Evolutionary programming (EP) was firstly proposed to simulate the evolution process and
    generate artificial intelligence and then applied in optimization domains.

    \begin{greenblock}{About sixty years ago}
      Researchers attempted to build the model of \alert{natural evolution} to realize the \alert{automatic programming}, \alert{sequence prediction} and so on. For example, Friedberg aimed to design the algorithm to find the program with certain inputs and outputs. 
    \end{greenblock}
    \column{0.13\textwidth}
    \begin{greenblock}{\textit{Friedberg}}
      The pioneer of automatic programming
    \end{greenblock}
  \end{columns}
  \begin{blueblock}{The performance of the method}
    Unfortunately, the mechanism proved worse even than a pure random search, resulted mainly by: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The absence of effective selection pressure
      \item The extreme disassociation(Small changes in program syntax usually cause large changes in the input-output behaviour of the program)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{blueblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Emerging of Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{greenblock}{In the 1960s}
    Having the knowledge of Friedberg’s disappointing results, Bremermann focused on the work of relatively simple optimization problems, especially for the linear programming and convex programming. 
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{blueblock}{The performance of the method}
    It is too limited for real optimization applications.
  \end{blueblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Emerging of Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{greenblock}{In 1964}
    L. J.Fogel formally proposed a kind of evolutionary algorithms, called evolutionary programming (EP).
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{greenblock}{The mechanism of EP}
    The individual, on behalf of a transition table of finite-state-machine (FSM), mutates to reproduce new FSMs, meanwhile, whether the individual was able to mutate in the next generation depended on the \alert{performance in the evaluation testing}. 
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{blueblock}{The performance of the method}
    Compared with Friedberg’s and Bremermann’s algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Applying EP algorithm to more sophisticated optimization problems
      \item Withith appropriate selective pressure provided
    \end{itemize}
  \end{blueblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Emerging of Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{greenblock}{In 1970s}
    Nevertheless, the refined work did not receive the remarkable attention in the field, until the \alert{genetic algorithm} and \alert{evolution strategies} were fully accepted in 1970s. 
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{block}{}
    The limitation in Friedberg and Bremermann’s experiments caused the ignorance of Fogel’s works in almost thirty years.

  \begin{block}{The characteristic of the initial EP}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fixed chromosome structure
      \item Changing numerical parameters evolving along with decision variables
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{redblock}{}
    The specific mechanism was brought by many other EAs and obtained a formal term, \alert{self-adaptation}.
  \end{redblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Classical Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{block}{The categories of initial EP algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \alert{Standard EP}, which has no self-adaptation specialities.
      \item \alert{Continuous standard EP}, different from the generation-based algorithms, in which, the individual is evaluated and added into the population.
      \item \alert{Meta-EP}, into which, the variance of mutation step size is cooperated.
      \item \alert{Continuous meta-EP}, in which, the individual is evaluated and added into the population due to the variance of the mutation operator.
      \item \alert{Rmeta-EP}, which cooperates covariances and standard deviations for self-adaptation.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{blueblock}{The key elements in the process of EP algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Representation of solutions
      \item Mutation operators
      \item Selection mechanisms
    \end{itemize}
  \end{blueblock}
\end{frame}

    The optimization domain $\bm x$, the space dimension ${D}$, the variances $\bm{\nu}$, the domain of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{block}{Representation}
    Individuals of standard EP can be described as:
    \begin{align}
      \mathbf{p}=(\bm{x},\bm{\nu})\tag{1}
    \end{align}
    where $\bm{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{D}$, $\bm{\nu}=\bm{0}$. \\
    Slightly different from standard EP, individuals in meta-EP represent can be described as:
    \begin{align}
      \mathbf{p}=(\bm{x},\bm{\nu})\tag{2}
    \end{align}
    where $\bm{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{D}, \bm{\nu}\in\mathbb{R_{+}}^{D}$.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Classical Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{greenblock}{}
    In standard EP, Gaussian mutation\index{G!Gaussian mutation} operator, with the form of $\mathbf{m}=(\{\beta_{1},\dots,\beta_{{D}}\}, \{\gamma_{1},\dots,\gamma_{{D}}\})$, is applied, where proportionality constant vector $\bm{\beta}$ and offset $\bm{\gamma}$ are parameters that must be tuned for a particular task. Often, however, constants in $\bm{\beta}$ and $\bm{\gamma}$ are set to one and zero respectively.
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{block}{Mutation (standard EP)}
    The operator works with a standard deviation that is determined by the square root of a linear transformation of the fitness value $f(\bm{x})$ for each element in variable vector. Mutating with Gaussian mutation operator, the element $ x_i $ in variable vector $ \bm{x} $ updated by:
    \begin{align}
      x'_{i}\leftarrow x_{i}+\sqrt{\beta_{i}\cdot f(\bm{x})+\gamma_{i}}\cdot \mathcal{N}_i(0,1)\tag{3}
      \end{align}
      where $\beta_{i}=1,\gamma_{i}=0$ are commonly used, therefore the mutation operator can be simplified:
      \begin{align}
      x'_{i}\leftarrow x_{i}+\sqrt{f(\bm{x})}\cdot \mathcal{N}_{i}(0,1)\tag{4}
      \end{align}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Classical Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{block}{The difficulties of the mutation operator used in standard EP}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When the fitness value is large, the step size in the search will be large, which results in almost like random search.
      \item It needs lots of efforts to tune the extra 2D parameters.
      \item If the fitness value of global optimum is not zero, the approaching to the global optimum is not possible.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Classical Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{block}{Mutation (meta-EP)}
    Compared with standard EP, meta-EP has main specialty of adapting variances to overcome the tuning difficulties. Different mutation operators combined with the variances vector $\bm{\nu} $ are applied:
    \begin{align}
      x'_i\leftarrow x_i+\sqrt{\nu_i}\cdot \mathcal{N}_i(0,1)\tag{5}\\
      \nu_i\leftarrow \nu_i+\sqrt{\zeta\cdot\nu_i}\cdot \mathcal{N}_i(0,1)\tag{6}
    \end{align}
    where the parameter $ \zeta $ is introduced to assure $ \bm{\nu} $ to be positive all the time.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Selection}
    Carrying out the mutation policy, all individuals produce its offspring, resulting in a larger population with the size of $2\mathtt{N}$. To reduce the size from $2\mathtt{N}$ back to $\mathtt{N}$, selection mechanism is requisite. For example, the tournament selection is a popular method to weed out $\mathtt{N}$ individuals based on fitness value in the pairwise comparison.
