\section{5.2 Evolutionary Programming}
\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming}
  \begin{block}{}
    Evolutionary programming (EP) was firstly proposed to simulate the evolution process and
    generate artificial intelligence and then applied in optimization domains.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{}
    There is a consistent pursuing for our human to obtain the artificial intelligence.
  \end{block}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \column{0.8\textwidth}
    \begin{greenblock}{About sixty years ago}
      Researchers attempted to build the model of \alert{natural evolution} to realize the \alert{automatic programming}, \alert{sequence prediction} and so on. For example, Friedberg aimed to design the algorithm to find the program with certain inputs and outputs. 
    \end{greenblock}
    \column{0.13\textwidth}
    \begin{greenblock}{\textit{Friedberg}}
      The pioneer of automatic programming
    \end{greenblock}
  \end{columns}
  \begin{blueblock}{The performance of the method}
    Unfortunately, the mechanism proved worse even than a pure random search, resulted mainly by: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The absence of effective selection pressure
      \item The extreme disassociation(Small changes in program syntax usually cause large changes in the input-output behaviour of the program)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{blueblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Emerging of Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{greenblock}{In the 1960s}
    Having the knowledge of Friedberg’s disappointing results, Bremermann focused on the work of relatively simple optimization problems, especially for the linear programming and convex programming. 
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{blueblock}{The performance of the method}
    It is too limited for real optimization applications.
  \end{blueblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Emerging of Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{greenblock}{In 1964}
    L. J.Fogel formally proposed a kind of evolutionary algorithms, called evolutionary programming (EP).
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{greenblock}{The mechanism of EP}
    The individual, on behalf of a transition table of finite-state-machine (FSM), mutates to reproduce new FSMs, meanwhile, whether the individual was able to mutate in the next generation depended on the \alert{performance in the evaluation testing}. 
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{blueblock}{The performance of the method}
    Compared with Friedberg’s and Bremermann’s algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Applying EP algorithm to more sophisticated optimization problems
      \item Withith appropriate selective pressure provided
    \end{itemize}
  \end{blueblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Emerging of Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{greenblock}{In 1970s}
    Nevertheless, the refined work did not receive the remarkable attention in the field, until the \alert{genetic algorithm} and \alert{evolution strategies} were fully accepted in 1970s. 
  \end{greenblock}
  \begin{block}{}
    The limitation in Friedberg and Bremermann’s experiments caused the ignorance of Fogel’s works in almost thirty years.

  \begin{block}{The characteristic of the initial EP}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fixed chromosome structure
      \item Changing numerical parameters evolving along with decision variables
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{redblock}{}
    The specific mechanism was brought by many other EAs and obtained a formal term, \alert{self-adaptation}.
  \end{redblock}

\begin{frame}
  {Evolutionary Programming\small{-The Classical Evolutionary Programming}}
  \begin{block}{The categories of initial EP algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \alert{Standard EP}, which has no self-adaptation specialities.
      \item \alert{Continuous standard EP}, different from the generation-based algorithms, in which, the individual is evaluated and added into the population.
      \item \alert{Meta-EP}, into which, the variance of mutation step size is cooperated.
      \item \alert{Continuous meta-EP}, in which, the individual is evaluated and added into the population due to the variance of the mutation operator.
      \item \alert{Rmeta-EP}, which cooperates covariances and standard deviations for self-adaptation.
